The Joy of Clojure
==================

- Lisp can be likened to a self-licking lollipop—more for mally defined as
  homoiconicity. 
- First-class functions can be stored, passed, and returned just like any other
  piece of data.

    Polymorphism is the ability of a function or method to perform different actions
    depending on the type of its arguments or a target object. Clojure provides polymor-
    phism via protocols,13 which let you attach a set of behaviors to any number of existing
    types and classes; they’re similar to what are sometimes called mix-ins, traits, or inter-
    faces in other languages and are more open and extensible than polymorphism in
    many languages.
