va source files are converted to Java class files by the Java compiler. The
Android SDK contains a tool called dx which converts Java class files into a
.dex (Dalvik Executable) file. All class files of the application are placed in
this .dex file. During this conversion process redundant information in the
class files are optimized in the .dex file. 

The .dex file and the resources of an Android project, e.g., the images and XML
files, are packed into an .apk
