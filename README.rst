NOTES
=====

Planning on taking my notes and putting them here
-------------------------------------------------

- Previously I used Sphinx but I Think it is a bit overkill sometimes, it's
  nice to update and regenerate only RST documents I have changed already.
- Easier to customize CSS of rst2html generated html pages than it is through
  sphinx templating.

You must always leave the code as good or in a better state than you found it.
