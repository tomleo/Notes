# Private vs. Public Classes

-   All variables and methods are accessable.
-   Functions with a starting with an underscore are conventionally
    private [^1]
-   Variables of a class can be directly accessed or you can use the
    @property decorator to create getters/setters/deleters.

# Python Imports

When you do from x import y, ALL of x is imported. Only y is brought
into the current namespace, **but the entire module x is processed**

``` python
#Module one
def a():
    print "a"
print "hi"
def b():
    print "b"
print "bye"

#Module two
from test import b
b()

#Running module two will output the following
hi
bye
b
```

Everything in moduel two was run, even though you only imported b [^2]

# Cyclic Imports

Cyclic imports are a sign that a module should probably be split up.

If for whatever reason you need to work with code with cyclical imports
which cannot be re-arranged, import foo is the only option. [^3]

``` python
#good
import myapp.utils as utils; utils.frobnicate()
import myapp.utils as U; U.frobnicate()

#bad
from myapp.utils import frobnicate

# If you're importing multiple things from one module, it's probably better
# to just import the module, and do module.bar, module.foo, module.baz, etc.,
# to keep the namespace clean. Avoid the following:
from myapp.utils import frobnicate, foo, bar, baz, MyClass, SomeOtherClass, # yada yada
```

## Subclassing unittest.TestCase

The following is a comment by Piet Delport (8:25 PM on 28 Oct 2012) [^4]

In Python (and any C3 class system), every class declaration should be
read as a single partial order: class A(B, C) should be understood to
mean that A &lt; B &lt; C, without putting special weight on A. (It can
help to mentally ignore the parentheses and actually read the syntax as
"class A &lt; B &lt; C: ...", when in doubt.)

In other words, the implication that B becomes a subclass of C is just
as important and meaningful as the implication that A becomes a subclass
of B. In particular, the question of swapping B and C around is no
different in general than the question of swapping A and B around, and
can have equally large repercussions.

Looking back at the example:

``` python
class RealTestCase(BaseTestCase, MyMixin):
```

This declaration should immediately jump out as a red flag: why is the
mixin being declared more general (BaseTestCase &lt; MyMixin), when it
actually depends on the setUp() method provided by BaseTestCase or its
ancestors (implying MyMixin &lt; BaseTestCase, or MyMixin &lt;
unittest.TestCase)?

This points to the more serious underlying bug:

``` python
class MyMixin(object):
    def setUp(self):
        super(MyMixin, self).setUp()
```

As it stands, this code is unconditionally buggy: it declares a
dependency on object alone (MyMixin &lt; object), but proceeds to
super-call a method (setUp()) that object does not provide.

Fixing this bug requires either removing the super-call (making MyMixin
the introducer of a new setUp() method), or inserting a dependency on an
appropriate base class (to extend its setUp() method):

``` python
class MyMixin(unittest.TestCase, object)  # MyMixin < TestCase < object
class MyMixin(unittest.TestCase)          # equivalent shorthand
```

The bug can also be papered over by adding the missing dependency in a
subclass:

``` python
class Foo(MyMixin, unittest.TestCase)  # MyMixin < TestCase
class Bar(MyMixin, BaseTestCase)       # MyMixin < BaseTestCase (< TestCase)
```

but this merely hides the underlying bug: any subclass that does not
declare MyMixin's dependency for it will still hit the problem.

## how can I examine pairs of characters in a string, stopping when I find an equal pair?
via [Breaking out of two loops](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201608/breaking_out_of_two_loops.html)
### Ned Batchelder

``` python
def unique_pairs(n):
    """Produce pairs of indexes in range(n)"""
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            yield i, j

s = "a string to examine"
for i, j in unique_pairs(len(s)):
    if s[i] == s[j]:
        answer = (i, j)
        break
```


### Gareth Rees

``` python
from itertools import combinations
for (i, a), (j, b) in combinations(enumerate(s), 2):
    if a == b:
        answer = i, j
        break
else:
    # Failed to find a matching pair â€” what now?
```

### Andrew Grigorev


``` python
it = ((i, j) for i in range(len(s)) for j in range(i + 1, len(s)))

for i, j in it:
    if s[i] == s[j]:
        answer = (i, j)
        break
```
        
``` python
answer = next(
    (i, j)
    for i in range(len(s))
    for j in range(i + 1, len(s))
    if s[i] == s[j]
)
```
